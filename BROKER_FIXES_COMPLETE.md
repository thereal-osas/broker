# Broker Application Fixes - All Issues Resolved

## âœ… **All 6 Issues Successfully Fixed**

### **ðŸ”§ Issue Resolution Summary**

---

## **1. Live Trade Investment Issues** âœ… **FIXED**

**Problem**: Users received "Live trade system not available, contact support" error when starting live trades

**Root Cause**: API was trying to access `users.balance` field which doesn't exist - the system uses `user_balances` table

**Solution Applied**:
- âœ… Updated balance validation to query `user_balances.total_balance` instead of `users.balance`
- âœ… Fixed balance deduction to update `user_balances.total_balance`
- âœ… Added proper transaction recording with `balance_type` field
- âœ… Enhanced error handling with specific error messages

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/live-trade/invest/route.ts` - Fixed balance queries and deduction logic

---

## **2. Investment Plan Activation Issues** âœ… **FIXED**

**Problem**: Users saw "Internal server error" but investments were created successfully

**Root Cause**: Transaction was failing due to referral commission query referencing non-existent `settings` table

**Solution Applied**:
- âœ… Fixed referral commission query to remove cross-join with settings table
- âœ… Used default commission rate (5%) when referral commission_rate is not set
- âœ… Updated transaction queries to use the transaction client properly
- âœ… Improved error handling to provide better user feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/investments/user/route.ts` - Fixed referral query and transaction handling

---

## **3. Balance Deduction Problems** âœ… **FIXED**

**Problem**: User balances weren't being deducted when investments or live trades were activated

**Root Cause**: APIs were using incorrect table references and balance update methods

**Solution Applied**:
- âœ… **Live Trade API**: Fixed to use `user_balances` table instead of `users.balance`
- âœ… **Investment API**: Already using correct `balanceQueries.updateBalance` method
- âœ… **Transaction Recording**: Added proper `balance_type` field to all transactions
- âœ… **Database Consistency**: Ensured all balance operations use the `user_balances` table

**Impact**: Both regular investments and live trades now properly deduct from user balances

---

## **4. Withdrawal Balance Deduction Issue** âœ… **VERIFIED**

**Problem**: Withdrawal approvals weren't deducting from user balances

**Investigation Result**: The withdrawal API was already correctly implemented with:
- âœ… Proper balance validation before approval
- âœ… Balance deduction on approval: `UPDATE user_balances SET total_balance = total_balance - $1`
- âœ… Transaction recording for audit trail
- âœ… Rollback mechanism for failed operations

**Status**: **Already Working Correctly** - No changes needed

---

## **5. Withdrawal Limit Enhancement** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**

**Problem**: Fixed $50,000 withdrawal limit regardless of user balance

**Solution Applied**:
- âœ… **Platform Settings API**: Created `/api/platform-settings` endpoint
- âœ… **Admin Configuration**: Added `max_withdrawal_percentage` setting (default: 100%)
- âœ… **Dynamic Calculation**: `maxWithdrawal = min(userBalance, maxAmount, userBalance * percentage)`
- âœ… **Admin Control**: Admins can set withdrawal percentage limits via settings
- âœ… **User Interface**: Shows percentage-based limits to users

**New Features**:
- Configurable withdrawal percentage (e.g., 80% of balance)
- Dynamic minimum/maximum amounts from admin settings
- Clear user feedback showing percentage limits

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/platform-settings/route.ts` - New API for settings
- `src/app/dashboard/withdraw/page.tsx` - Dynamic limit calculation
- `src/app/admin/settings/page.tsx` - Added withdrawal percentage setting

---

## **6. Cryptocurrency Withdrawal Enhancement** âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**

**Problem**: Users couldn't specify which cryptocurrency when selecting crypto withdrawal

**Solution Applied**:
- âœ… **Cryptocurrency Selection**: Added dropdown with 10 popular cryptocurrencies
- âœ… **Dynamic Labels**: Wallet address label updates based on selected crypto
- âœ… **Enhanced Validation**: Crypto-specific placeholder text and validation
- âœ… **Better UX**: Clear instructions for each cryptocurrency type

**Supported Cryptocurrencies**:
- Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC)
- Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE)
- Litecoin (LTC), Polygon (MATIC)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/dashboard/withdraw/page.tsx` - Added crypto selection dropdown and enhanced UI
