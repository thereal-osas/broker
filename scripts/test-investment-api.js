console.log('🧪 Investment Balance Deduction Fix - Manual Test Instructions');
console.log('============================================================\n');

console.log('📋 Test Steps:');
console.log('==============\n');

console.log('1. 🚀 Start the development server:');
console.log('   npm run dev\n');

console.log('2. 👤 Login as a test user or create a new account\n');

console.log('3. 💰 Check initial balance:');
console.log('   - Go to the dashboard');
console.log('   - Note the current total balance');
console.log('   - Note the current deposit balance (if visible in admin)\n');

console.log('4. 📈 Make an investment:');
console.log('   - Go to /dashboard/investments');
console.log('   - Choose an investment plan');
console.log('   - Enter an investment amount (e.g., $100)');
console.log('   - Submit the investment\n');

console.log('5. ✅ Verify the fix:');
console.log('   - Check that the total balance decreased by the investment amount');
console.log('   - Go to /dashboard/transactions');
console.log('   - Verify that an investment transaction was recorded');
console.log('   - Check that the transaction shows balance_type as "deposit"\n');

console.log('6. 🔍 Expected Results:');
console.log('   ✅ Total balance should be: Initial Balance - Investment Amount');
console.log('   ✅ Transaction should appear in transaction history');
console.log('   ✅ Transaction type should be "investment"');
console.log('   ✅ Transaction balance_type should be "deposit"');
console.log('   ✅ Investment should appear in investments list\n');

console.log('7. 🐛 Before the fix (what was broken):');
console.log('   ❌ Total balance would remain unchanged after investment');
console.log('   ❌ User could make unlimited investments without balance deduction');
console.log('   ❌ Balance and transaction records would be inconsistent\n');

console.log('8. 🎯 After the fix (what should work now):');
console.log('   ✅ Total balance properly decreases when making investments');
console.log('   ✅ Balance deduction is consistent with transaction records');
console.log('   ✅ Users cannot invest more than their available balance\n');

console.log('📝 Code Changes Made:');
console.log('====================');
console.log('File: src/app/api/investments/user/route.ts');
console.log('');
console.log('BEFORE (broken):');
console.log('  await balanceQueries.updateBalance(');
console.log('    session.user.id,');
console.log('    "total_balance",    // ❌ This gets overwritten by recalculation');
console.log('    amount,');
console.log('    "subtract"');
console.log('  );');
console.log('');
console.log('AFTER (fixed):');
console.log('  await balanceQueries.updateBalance(');
console.log('    session.user.id,');
console.log('    "deposit_balance",  // ✅ This properly updates and recalculates total');
console.log('    amount,');
console.log('    "subtract"');
console.log('  );');
console.log('');
console.log('Also updated transaction record:');
console.log('  balanceType: "deposit"  // ✅ Matches the actual balance type affected');
console.log('');

console.log('🔧 Technical Explanation:');
console.log('=========================');
console.log('The updateBalance() function in lib/db.ts works as follows:');
console.log('1. Updates the specified balance type (e.g., deposit_balance)');
console.log('2. Automatically recalculates total_balance as the sum of all balance types');
console.log('3. When we tried to update "total_balance" directly, step 2 overwrote our change');
console.log('4. By updating "deposit_balance" instead, the recalculation works correctly\n');

console.log('🎉 The fix ensures that:');
console.log('- Investment amounts are properly deducted from user balances');
console.log('- Transaction records accurately reflect the balance changes');
console.log('- Data consistency is maintained between balances and transactions');
console.log('- Users cannot invest more than their available balance\n');

console.log('To run this test, start the development server and follow the steps above.');
