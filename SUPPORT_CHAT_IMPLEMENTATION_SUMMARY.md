# 💬 Support Chat System Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Implementation Status: COMPLETE**

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive support chat system for your broker application, along with fixing the login issues.

---

## 🔐 **1. Login Issue Resolution**

### **✅ Issue Fixed: NEXTAUTH_URL Configuration**

**Problem Identified:**
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` was set to production URL instead of localhost
- This caused authentication redirects to fail during development

**Solution Applied:**
```env
# Fixed in .env file
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Changed from production URL
```

**Test Credentials:**
- **Investor**: `john@gmail.com` / `password123`
- **Admin**: `admin@broker.com` / `Admin123`
